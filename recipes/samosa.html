    <OL>
        <li>Heat the oil. In a large frying pan, heat the 4 tablespoon (59.1 ml) of oil.</li>
        <li> Fry the onions. Over a medium heat, stir fry the onions for about 1 minute. Now add the spices and chilies and fry until onions are golden brown.</li>
        <li>Add the meat. Now add the minced meat and fry it until it is browned. Stir for a few more minutes and add peas.</li>
        <li> Cook the meat. Cover and cook on a low heat for 20 minutes until the meat is cooked (tender). Add oil if the pan seems to be too dry and make sure you stir it occasionally. Add salt if necessary. Leave to cool</li>
        <li> Preparing the cone. Take a sheet of the ready made samosa pad or 2 sheets of Filo pastry and make a triangle cone by folding the edges around themselves and sealing the edges with the beaten egg using a pastry brush. Make sure to leave one side open to add the filling.</li> 
        <li> Fill it with meat mixture. Now fill the samosa cone with minced meat. Lift and pinch the corners together and continue along the seam towards the corner. View the video to see how this is done.</li>
        <li> Cover the finished samosas with a moist cloth as you continue to make more.</li>
        <li> Deep fry the samosa gently until it they are golden in colour on each of their sides. Do not fry them fast as it may make them stiff</li>
